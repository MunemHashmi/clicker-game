# Clicker Game
Welcome to Clicker Game! In this game, you have just 10 seconds to click a button as many times as possible. The HTML file includes a title, instructions, a timer, a button, and a score display. The CSS file styles the elements in the HTML file to create a visually appealing user interface. The JavaScript file declares the variables for the timer and score, updates the timer every second using a countdown, disables the button when the time is up, and increments the score each time the button is clicked.

## How to Play

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Click the button as many times as possible within 10 seconds.
3. Your score will be displayed at the end of the game.
